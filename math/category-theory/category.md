# category

A **category** consists of a set $ C_0 $ of objects and for each $ X, Y \in C_0
$ a set $ C_1(X, Y) $ of morphisms going from $ X $ to $ Y $ such that

-   for each $ f \in C_1(X, Y) $ and $ g \in C_1(Y, Z) $, $ g \circ f \in C_1(X,
    Z) $ called their composite
-   for each object $ X \in C_0 $, $ 1_X \in C_1(X, X) $ called the identity
    morphism on $ X $
-   composition is a monoid operation[1]
