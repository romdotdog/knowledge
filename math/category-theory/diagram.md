# diagram

A **diagram** in a [category](./category.md) $C$ consists of some
[objects](./wild-category.md) of $C$ connected by some
[morphisms](./wild-category.md) of $C$.[^1]

## with functors

If $C$ is a category and $J$ is a small category, a diagram of type $J$ in $C$
is a covariant functor $F: J \to C$.[^1] [^2]
