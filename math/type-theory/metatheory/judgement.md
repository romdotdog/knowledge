# judgement

A **judgement** is an metalingual assertion about a theory.[^1]

In meta-type theory, there are two kinds of judgements:[^2]

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1. $a$ is a **term** of **type** $A$ (and thus $A$ is **inhabited**)
$$a:A$$
2. $a$ and $a'$ are **judgementally equal terms** of type $A$
$$a \equiv a': A$$
