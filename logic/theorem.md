# theorem

A **theorem** $ T $ is an inhabited [proposition](/logic/proposition.md).[1]
This means that there is a term $ p: T $ (also called a "witness" or "proof") of
the theorem. All theorems are equal to [verum](/logic/curry-howard.md).

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
For example, there is a type $ T_{\text{Py}} $ of proofs that $ a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$ where $ a $ and $ b $ are legs of a right triangle, and $ c $ is its
hypotenuse. The propositional truncation $ \left\| T_{\text{Py}} \right\| $ has
a proof if and only if there is a proof of $ T_{\text{Py}} $. Wikipedia says
there are more than 370 proofs of the Pythagorean equation, so
$ \left\| T_{\text{Py}} \right\| $ is a theorem.[2]
