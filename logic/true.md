# true

A [theorem](/logic/proposition.md) is **true** if there is a
[fact](/logic/fact.md) that corresponds with it.[1]

For example, the theorem that the circumference of the unit circle is $ 2
\int_0^1 \sqrt{\frac{1}{1-x^2}}\,\mathrm dx = 2\pi $ corresponds with the fact
that if you have a circular object and you measure its radius with a measuring
tape to be 1 meter, you will see a circumference of (roughly) $ 2\pi $ meters if
you wrap your tape around the object.
