# belief

A [proposition](../math/type-theory/proposition.md) is a person's **belief** if they consider
it to be [true](../logic/true.md).[^1]

A belief is called a **crony belief** if it has been adopted primarily to make a
certain impression on others.[^2] A belief is called a **merit belief** if it
has been adopted primarily to accurately model the world.[^2] Thus, beliefs have
two dimensions: _pragmatic value_ and _social value_.[^2]

Humans are incentivized to have crony beliefs because adopting the beliefs that
would make them the most allies increases their chances of survival.[^2]

Usually, letting go of misbeliefs and adopting new beliefs with more pragmatic
value is a pleasure:

> If I believe that my daughter's soccer game starts at 6pm, but my neighbor
> informs me that it's 5pm, I won't begrudge his correction — I'll be downright
> grateful.[^2]

For crony beliefs, this is not the case, since crony beliefs optimize for social
value, not pragmatic value.[^2]
