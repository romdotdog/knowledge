# belief

A [proposition](/logic/proposition.md) is a person's **belief** if they consider
it to be [true](/logic/truth.md).[1]

A belief is called a crony belief if it has been adopted primarily to make a
certain impression on others.[2] A belief is called a merit belief if it has
been adopted primarily to accurately model the world.[2] Thus, beliefs have two
dimensions: pragmatic value and social value.

Humans are incentivized to have crony beliefs because adopting the beliefs that
would make them the most allies increases their chances of survival.[2]

Usually, letting go of misbeliefs and adopting new beliefs with more pragmatic
value is a pleasure:

> If I believe that my daughter's soccer game starts at 6pm, but my neighbor
> informs me that it's 5pm, I won't begrudge his correction â€” I'll be downright
> grateful.[2]

For crony beliefs, this is not the case, since crony beliefs optimize for social
value, not pragmatic value.[2]
