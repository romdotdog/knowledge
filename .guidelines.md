# guidelines

These guidelines are for the _formatting_ of the files. Ideas about the
structure of the knowledge base belong in [/this.md](/this.md).

`.*` globs and the top-level `readme.md` are meta to the knowledge base. For
example, [/.assistant/](/.assistant/) contains the LLM I use to assist with the
construction of the knowledge base. Meta paths are not accessible to the LLM.

Every file in the knowledge base shall be sorted in chronological order, unless
otherwise indicated.

File and directory names in the knowledge base shall be lowercased, with spaces
replaced with hyphens. The first line of each file ending in `.md` shall be the
name of the file (without the file extension) as an h1.
