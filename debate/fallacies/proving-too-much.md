# proving-too-much

An [argument](../../logic/argument.md) **proves too much** if its
[conclusion](../../logic/argument.md) [implies](../../math/type-theory/curry-howard.md) a
[proposition](../../math/type-theory/proposition.md) that implies
[falsum](../../math/type-theory/curry-howard.md).[^1]

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
> For example, if someone says "[God exists because you can't prove that he
> doesn't]", you can answer "That argument proves too much. If we accept it,
> we must also accept that [Bigfoot exists], since itâ€™s impossible to disprove
> his existence as well."[^2]
