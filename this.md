This project is a knowledge base. It will be called **this knowledge base** for
the purposes of this document.

This knowledge base shall contain as many [propositions](/logic/proposition.md)
that I care to [believe](/epistemology/belief.md) as possible.

Ideas conceived externally (i.e. outside of this knowledge base, for which a
[definition](/logic/definition.md) can be found on the web, in a book, etc.)
shall be cited in the knowledge base in any reasonable format.

Ideas conceived internally shall be defined in terms of the concepts already
defined within this knowledge base.

Ideas do not have to be written in a manner that is easy to understand.
